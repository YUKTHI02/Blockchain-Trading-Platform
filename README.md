# Blockchain-Trading-Platform

## A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared among a computer network's nodes. They are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, but they are not limited to cryptocurrency uses. Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutableâ€”the term used to describe the inability to be altered. ##

# Local Setup:

Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
Before you can use Next.js, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. Node.js allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side, and npm is used to manage packages and dependencies.

Download Node.js: Visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/) and download the LTS version suitable for your operating system.

Install Node.js: Run the inStep 

2: Create a New Project Directory

Create a New Folder: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where y
ou want to create your Next.js project.
Create the Project Directory: Run the following command to create a new directory for your project:
*mkdir next-review
Navigate to the Project Directory: Move into the newly created directory using:
*cd next-review
 
follow the installation instructions. 
This will also install npm along with react.js and react dom.
*npm install next react react-dom.

Step 4: Start the Development Server



Start the Server: After the project is created, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command to start the development server:

* npm run dev

Access the App: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see the default Next.js starter app running.

Step 5: Explore the Project

Project Structure: Next.js has generated a basic project structure for you. Key folders include pages (where your route-based components will go),
 public (for static assets), and styles (for global styles).

Pages: In the pages folder, you'll find the page.jsx file, layout.jsx which corresponds to the homepage route. You can add more .js or .jsx files here to create new routes
